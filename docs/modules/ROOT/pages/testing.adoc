= Testing Antora sites

This project provides utilities and guidelines for testing Antora documentation sites.

Quarkiverse projects usually host their Antora documentation in a dedicated `docs` Maven module.
After adding the `quarkus-antora` dependency, you can not only
xref:index.adoc#dev-mode[life-edit the site in Quarkus dev mode] but also

* Test that Antora is able to generate the site from your AsciiDoc sources
* Ensure that all external links are valid.

== Basic `@QuarkusTest`

The way we test the site generation is not much different from
https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing[testing any other Quarkus application].

First, you need to add the necessary dependencies

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::example$testing/pom.xml[tag=basic-test]
----

Then you can add a basic `@QuarkusTest` as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::example$testing/AntoraSiteTest.java[tag=getIndex]
    ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
The sample code snippets used in this section come from the
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-antora/tree/main/docs[`docs` module] of Quarkus Antora

== Detect dead links with `AntorAssured`

Antora takes care for validating internal cross-references but it does not help much with ensuring
that external links point to existing resources.
Page fragments (the part starting with `#` in `page.html#anchor`) are not validated by Antora too.

That's where the `io.quarkiverse.antorassured.AntorAssured` class provided by Quarkus Antora may come in handy.

To use it, you need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::example$testing/pom.xml[tag=dead-links]
----

Then you can use it in a test as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::example$testing/AntoraSiteTest.java[tag=externalLinks]
----

In the test, we instruct the link validator to ignore some remote URIs, that we intentionally placed into `test-page.adoc`
for the sake of testing `AntoraAssured` itself.

If you would like to see the dead link detection in action, just remove the whole `excludeResolved(...)` method invocation.
After that, you should see the test fail with a report like the following:
